<h>Shakpak-ata - underground mosque in Mangistau region<h>

<p> Shakpak-ata is a unique architectural monument located in the northeastern part of the Tyub-Karagan peninsula in the Mangistau region, in the Shilikuduk tract. The mosque was carved out in the thickness of a rocky promontory formed by the channels of two ravines, descending along the slope of Mount Ungazy to one of the bays of the Caspian Sea. People come here from all over the country: some for tourist purposes, and some - to pray or be healed.
According to local legends, a healer Shakpak-ata lived in a cave on the side of a mountain long ago. From all the surrounding territories, people came to him for the healing of soul and body. Centuries have passed, the elder is gone, but people still come to the cave so that the power of the ancient healer would help them. According to another legend, a great warrior lived in a cave. He was named Shakpak-ata (Old Man-Flint), since even in old age he did not lose his mighty strength.<p>
